  <div class="about-text"> 
  <p>Today’s technical interviews are conducted using a confusing mix of various applications requiring users to navigate through many different interfaces. HackBox solves this problem by creating an easy-to-use platform with video, text and canvas capabilities.</p> 
  <p>HackBox streamlines the entire interview process. Scheduling interviews, live-coding and reviewing a candidate’s data at a later date is intuitive and efficient. We leverage the MEAN stack and Icecomm.io, Fabric.js, and Ace Text Editor APIs to provide a simple yet powerful interview platform.</p>

  <h1>How It Works</h1>
  <p>Interviewers sign in to a personalized dashboard page with GitHub authentication and are presented with their upcoming interviews. Scheduling interviews and notifying interviewees is effortless using our built-in scheduling form.</p> 
  <p>When it is time for the interview, a unique, private room becomes available that the interviewer and candidate access with a link. Code and diagrams from the interview are saved and can be reviewed by the interviewer.</p>

      <h1>FAQ</h1>
      <p class="q">Q: Do I have to have video and audio?</p>
      <p>A: The application should work fine without either video, audio or both. If you do not have a video or audio on your computer, the app will simply not use those features. However, you must select 'Allow' from the browser pop-up permission request to enable the data streaming that allows users to share code and the canvas. 
      <p class="q">Q: Why is my video not working?</p>
      <p>A: When you enter an interview room our application needs your permission to access your camera and microphone. Please select 'Allow' to enable the video and data sharing features of the application.</p>
      <p class="q">Q: Nothing appeared for me to select 'Allow' when I entered the room. Where is this button?</p>
      <p>A: Some browser settings automatically disable web applications from accessing your microphone and camera. Most of the time you can create a media exception for application so that we are not automatically disabled, but instead asks you if we can have access to your camera and microphone. Additionally, due to inconsistencies in Google Chrome privacy features, we find that a small number Chrome users have difficulty allowing the app stream data including the video. If this is the case for you, we recommend using Firefox instead.</p>
      <p class="q">Q: Why am I redirected to a 404 page when I try to access my interview?</p>
      <p>A: While interviewers have perpetual access to interview rooms to prepare questions and review responses. All other users are redirected to our 404 page if he or she attempts to access an interview room that is not yet open.</p>
